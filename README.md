- `GA_for_rocks.ipynb`
Arrangement of rocks laying. There will be a total of 80 rock, which different weight and we need to place all rock in 8 rows x 10 columns, in which each row must have the total weight of the stones as close as possible.
- `GA_undersampling_small.ipynb`
This is a project to solve imbalanced data based on undersampling. I want to keep the data distribution of the majority class still almost unchanged when undersampling. Therefore I create an objective function by minimizing the difference between the median, mean, and variance of the original majority class and the new majority class.
